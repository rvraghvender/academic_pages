excerpt: 'An interatomic potential for simulating the structural properties of thallium (I) oxide (with oxidation state +1) based compounds has been developed by fitting to the experimental crystalline structures of α-Tl2Te2O5, Tl2Te3O7 and Tl2TeO3 simultaneously. The obtained potentials are subsequently verified and validated by optimizing additional Tl(I)−O based compounds, leading to a good agreement of the lattice constants with experimental data. Amorphous (TlO0.5)x − (TeO2)1-x systems where then produced by classical molecular dynamics and their structural properties compared to experimental measurements.'
